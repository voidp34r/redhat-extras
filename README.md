# `bitnami/redhat-extras`

## TL;DR

```dockerfile
FROM bitnami/redhat-extras
```

## About

The `bitnami/redhat-extras` image is a customized base image for use in Bitnami container images and is built on top of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux image. 

The `Dockerfile` installs [Nami](https://github.com/bitnami/nami) and includes a `bitnami-pkg` helper script to simplify downloading of Nami modules from the Bitnami package repositories. Additionally the `Dockerfile` installs [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)  and is used in the default [entrypoint](../../blob/master/rootfs/entrypoint.sh).

## Usage

Use like a regular base image.

The following example uses the `install_packages` helper script, provided by `minideb`, to install APT packages from the Debian repositories. The `bitnami-pkg` tool to install `nami` packages published by Bitnami.

```dockerfile
FROM bitnami/redhat-extras:jessie
ENV BITNAMI_APP_NAME=apache
RUN install_packages wget apr apr-util bzip2-libs glibc libcom_err libcurl expat libffi \ 
    freetype libgcc libgcrypt gmp gnutls libgpg-error cyrus-sasl-gssapi libicu libidn \
    libjpeg-turbo krb5-libs keyutils-libs openldap xz-libs libtomcrypt ncurses-libs \
    nettle p11-kit pcre2 libpng libpng12 readline cyrus-sasl-lib libssh2 openssl-libs \
    libstdc++ libtasn1 libuuid libxml2 libxslt zlib
RUN bitnami-pkg install apache-2.4.25-0
CMD ["nami", "start", "--foreground", "apache"]
```

## Configuration Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the image.

|         Parameter         |                       Description                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `BASH_DEBUG`              | [Turn on bash debugging](#turn-on-bash-debugging)       |
| `NAMI_DEBUG`              | [Turn on nami debugging](#turn-on-nami-debugging)       |
| `DISABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE` | [Turn off the welcome text](#turn-off-the-welcome-text) |

### Turn on BASH debugging

Add `BASH_DEBUG=1` to the container environment to enable [BASH debugging](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/debuggingtips#use_shell_debug_output) which prints the commands being executed.

### Turn on Nami debugging

To enable debugging add `NAMI_DEBUG=1` to the container environment. The `NAMI_DEBUG` variable enables helpful logging and debugging features which can be valuable for debugging issues.

### Turn off the welcome text

When a new container is launched, a welcome message is displayed as illustrated below:

```console
 *** Welcome to the apache image ***
 *** Brought to you by Bitnami ***
 *** More information: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache ***
 *** Issues: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache/issues ***
```

Adding `DISABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE=1` to the container environment turns off this message.
